Descriptive Features
The variable description is produced here from the heart-disease.names file:
• Age: age in years
• Gender: gender (1 = male; 0 = female)
• Cp: chest pain type
o Value 1: typical angina
o Value 2: atypical angina
o Value 3: non-anginal pain
o Value 4: asymptomatic
• Trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
• Chol: serum cholesterol in mg/dl
• Fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false)
• Restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
o Value 0: normal
o Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 005 mV)
o Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertropy by Estes criteria
• Thalach: maximum heart rate achieved in beats per minute (bpm)
• Exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
• Oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
• Slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
o Value 1: upsloping
o Value 2: flat
o Value 3: down-sloping
• Ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy
• Thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversible defect
The target feature has two classes and hence it is a binary classification problem. To reiterate, the goal is to predict whether a person has heart disease.
